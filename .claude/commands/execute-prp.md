# Execute DoX PRP

Implement a DoX feature using the PRP file.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all context and requirements
   - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the PRP fully
   - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed
   - Check existing DoX patterns in src/ and mcp-server/

2. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan
   - Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using TodoWrite
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing DoX code to follow
   - Consider Supabase RLS and authentication patterns
   - Plan MCP tool integration if needed

3. **Execute the plan**
   - Execute the PRP
   - Implement all the code following DoX conventions
   - Use existing patterns from src/components, src/lib, mcp-server/src
   - Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
   - Maintain consistency with Big 12 branding (colors, fonts)

4. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command
   - Fix any failures
   - Re-run until all pass
   - Test Supabase queries work correctly
   - Verify MCP tools function if implemented

5. **Complete**
   - Ensure all checklist items done
   - Run final validation suite
   - Report completion status
   - Read the PRP again to ensure you have implemented everything
   - Verify no TypeScript errors
   - Check that Supabase types are properly used

6. **Reference the PRP**
   - You can always reference the PRP again if needed
   - Check CLAUDE.md for DoX-specific guidelines

Note: If validation fails, use error patterns in PRP to fix and retry. Pay special attention to Supabase authentication and MCP server integration.
